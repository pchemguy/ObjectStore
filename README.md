The ObjectStore class simulates weak references via a Dictionary-based registry ([Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://books.google.com/books?id=FyWZt5DdvFkC)) and scalar keys as object handles. Documentation is available from [GitHub pages](https://pchemguy.github.io/ObjectStore/).
